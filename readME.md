Decription: 
*Weather Search Application - (I have created a search application that calls APIs to display detailed weather forecasts for cities upon search using a combination of HTML, CSS/Bootstrap and dynamic JS/JQuery.  The scheduler contains a current forecast, as well as a five-day forecast. UV ratings color-coded based on risk level. When searches are executed, the cities will be saved in a newly created button and can be toggled back to later.  Searched cities are saved to local storage, and the most recent search will populate upion re-navigating to or refreshing the page.)
